# Day 1 Tue,Jul 9

The first day of college began with our arrival at the college Gurudwara Sahib from 9 AM to 10 AM. After seeking blessings from Guruji, we had a tea break. Before the start of our new batch in 2024, we were taken to the college auditorium. About 30 minutes later, the host introduced Ms. Harpreet Kaur as the first speaker of the Student Induction Program. She is the Head of the Applied Science department. She did her best to help us feel comfortable in the new college environment and discussed how unity among peers is a powerful tool for solving the problems we may encounter in the future.

The second speaker was our college principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh. He spoke about the education system and shared his experiences from the time he joined the college to the present day. Finally, we were energized by a speech given by S. Harjinder Dhami. In his address, he spoke about the value of the education we are receiving and encouraged us to look forward to solving problems with the help of technical education. Thus, the first day of the induction program ended with new thoughts and a refreshed mindset.


# Day 2 Thu,Jul 11


After reaching the auditorium at 8:45 AM, the volunteers showed us our seats. At 9 AM, Ms. Harpreet Kaur welcomed us warmly. After that, the host invited Dr. Arvind Dhingra, President of Technical and Director of STEP. He informed us about the numerous societies and clubs available for student development. Dr. Parminder Singh then provided a detailed overview of the scholarships offered by the college.

In the final lecture, we had the opportunity to learn a lot from Dr. Hardeep Rai, a valuable source of information. His views on examinations were as fascinating as expected. He also expressed his readiness to offer us wonderful opportunities to work with him and gain access to free and open-source software efficiently.


# Day 3 Fri,Jul 12

I reached class at 9 am, where we had the chance to learn about human values as recommended by AICTE. I learned how ethics and moral values are necessary to accomplish any task and to make our lives successful. After that, we got a chance to interact with our seniors. They discussed their experiences and explained the grading system (revaluation), library cards, and the importance of enrolling ourselves on the official college website. These are necessary things we need to know about and benefit from. "There is a holiday on Saturday and Sunday, so I go home on Friday evening for the next two days because I am a hosteller."


# Day 4 Mon,Jul 15

Day 4 again started in the auditorium. Dr. Randhir Singh was the first speaker of the day. He briefed us about the Induction Program and the various criteria for passing it. He explained that all the students need to pass an English Proficiency Test, a Mathematics Test, submit an e-certificate in any course, and a report about their experience at GNDEC using GitHub Pages. He also informed the students about the upcoming Mid Semester Examinations and the marks distribution for it.

Then, Dr. Pyara Lal Garg, a former Pediatric Surgery Professor, addressed the students. He told us that times have changed, but one thing that has not changed is the learning attitude of humans. It has been the biggest reason behind the enormous developments that mankind has been able to make. He also explained that you are bound to face problems when you start, but once you have started and are determined enough, you can achieve any goal in your life. He said that we always look for the negatives while ignoring the positives. When we start looking at the positive side of things, life becomes much better. He emphasized that we must never blame someone before introspecting ourselves.

Afterwards, Mr. Sony Goyal, Founder of Mission CAT and a motivational speaker, provided clear guidance about setting and achieving our goals. He shared with us two success mantras:

Always give your 100%
Do what you love and love what you do
He also shared another mantra called LIFE:

Learn
Inquire
Future
Explore
The final speaker of the day was Mr. Pancham Singh, a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering student at GNE. He provided insights on body language, explaining the 7-38-55 rule, which means that words convey only 7% of a message, while voice tone and body language account for 38% and 55%, respectively. He also presented a few slides on how to interpret what another personâ€™s body language is communicating, such as whether they are aggressive, defensive, interested, or disinterested in listening. He also shared how to distinguish between real and fake smiles
