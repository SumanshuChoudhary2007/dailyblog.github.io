# Day 1

The first day of college began with our arrival at the college Gurudwara Sahib from 9 AM to 10 AM. After seeking blessings from Guruji, we had a tea break. Before the start of our new batch in 2024, we were taken to the college auditorium. About 30 minutes later, the host introduced Ms. Harpreet Kaur as the first speaker of the Student Induction Program. She is the Head of the Applied Science department. She did her best to help us feel comfortable in the new college environment and discussed how unity among peers is a powerful tool for solving the problems we may encounter in the future.

The second speaker was our college principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh. He spoke about the education system and shared his experiences from the time he joined the college to the present day. Finally, we were energized by a speech given by S. Harjinder Dhami. In his address, he spoke about the value of the education we are receiving and encouraged us to look forward to solving problems with the help of technical education. Thus, the first day of the induction program ended with new thoughts and a refreshed mindset.


# Day 2


After reaching the auditorium at 8:45 AM, the volunteers showed us our seats. At 9 AM, Ms. Harpreet Kaur welcomed us warmly. After that, the host invited Dr. Arvind Dhingra, President of Technical and Director of STEP. He informed us about the numerous societies and clubs available for student development. Dr. Parminder Singh then provided a detailed overview of the scholarships offered by the college.

In the final lecture, we had the opportunity to learn a lot from Dr. Hardeep Rai, a valuable source of information. His views on examinations were as fascinating as expected. He also expressed his readiness to offer us wonderful opportunities to work with him and gain access to free and open-source software efficiently.


# Day 3

I reached class at 9 am, where we had the chance to learn about human values as recommended by AICTE. I learned how ethics and moral values are necessary to accomplish any task and to make our lives successful. After that, we got a chance to interact with our seniors. They discussed their experiences and explained the grading system (revaluation), library cards, and the importance of enrolling ourselves on the official college website. These are necessary things we need to know about and benefit from.
